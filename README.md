# Ugly Duck Solidity Contract

## Overview
This repository contains the `ugly_duck.sol` Solidity smart contract. It appears to include and utilize OpenZeppelin libraries and follows standard practices for creating Ethereum-based smart contracts. The contract is written in Solidity version 0.8.0 or higher.

## Key Features
- **SPDX License**: The contract is licensed under the MIT License, allowing for reuse and modification.
- **OpenZeppelin Libraries**: Utilizes industry-standard libraries from OpenZeppelin for functionality like:
  - ERC165 Interface Support.
  - Additional utilities to enhance security and functionality.
- **Compliance with Standards**: Implements or supports widely accepted Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs).

## Prerequisites
To work with this contract, you need:
- **Node.js** and **npm** (for development environment setup).
- **Hardhat** or **Truffle** (for smart contract deployment and testing).
- **Solidity Compiler** version 0.8.0 or higher.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd <project-directory>
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## Usage
1. Compile the contract using your preferred development framework:
   ```bash
   npx hardhat compile
   ```
2. Deploy the contract:
   ```bash
   npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js
   ```
   Replace `scripts/deploy.js` with the deployment script provided in your project.
3. Interact with the deployed contract using a tool like Hardhat, Truffle, or Ethers.js.

## Testing
Unit tests are an integral part of smart contract development. Use the following command to run tests:
```bash
npx hardhat test
```

Ensure that all test cases pass before deploying the contract to a live network.
